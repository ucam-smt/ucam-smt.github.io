Possibly multithreading with 1 thread would do, but I keep both implementations as any plain bug that might arise will be easier to trace down with a serialized execution (threadpool uses two, actually). The class is templated with two classes, one for single threading and another for multithreading. Note that the multithreading details are up to the second templated class.
