Possibly multithreading with 1 thread would do, but I keep both implementations as any plain bug that might arise will be easier to trace down with a single thread execution. The class is templated three functors, one for each type of execution Note that the details are up to the each of these functors." alt="" coords="5,5,184,91"/>
