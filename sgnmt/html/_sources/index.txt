SGNMT
========

SGNMT is an open-source framework for neural machine translation (NMT) and other sequence prediction
tasks. The tool provides a flexible platform which allows pairing NMT with various other models such 
as language models, length models, or bag2seq models. It supports rescoring both n-best lists and lattices.
A wide variety of search strategies is available for complex decoding problems. 

SGNMT is compatible with multiple NMT implementations based on `Theano <http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/>`_
(`Blocks <http://blocks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_) and `TensorFlow <https://www.tensorflow.org/>`_ (the
`extended seq2seq tutorial <https://github.com/ehasler/tensorflow>`_ and `tensor2tensor <https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor>`_).

Quickstart
------------

For example, NMT decoding can be started with this command::

    $ python decode.py --predictors nmt --src_test sentences.txt

where sentences.txt is a plain (indexed) text file with sentences. Rescoring OpenFST
lattices with NMT is also straight-forward::

    $ python decode.py --predictors nmt,fst --fst_path lattices/%d.fst --src_test sentences.txt

See the :ref:`tutorial-label` for more examples.
