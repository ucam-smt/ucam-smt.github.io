SGNMT
========

SGNMT is an open-source framework for neural machine translation (NMT). The tool provides
a flexible platform which allows pairing NMT with various other models such as language models,
length models, or bag2seq models. It supports rescoring both n-best lists and lattice rescoring.
A wide variety of search strategies is available for complex decoding problems. 
SGNMT is compatible with Blocks/Theano and TensorFlow.

Quickstart
------------

For example, NMT decoding can be started with this command::

    $ python decode.py --predictors nmt --src_test sentences.txt

where sentences.txt is a plain (indexed) text file with sentences. Rescoring OpenFST
lattices with NMT is also straight-forward::

    $ python decode.py --predictors nmt,fst --fst_path lattices/%d.fst --src_test sentences.txt

See the :ref:`tutorial-label` for more examples.
