{"name":"UCAM-SMT","tagline":"The Cambridge Statistical Machine Translation system","body":"# Introduction\r\n\r\nThis open source package contains the Cambridge SMT system, a set of tools for statistical machine translation, which rely on [OpenFST](www.openfst.org). You can download it [here](https://github.com/ucam-smt/ucam-smt/archive/master.zip).\r\n\r\n## Features Included in this Release\r\n\r\n- HiFST -- Hierarchical phrase-based statistical machine translation system based on OpenFST.\r\n- Direct production of translation lattices as Weighted Finite State Automata\r\n- Efficient WFSA rescoring procedures\r\n- OpenFst wrappers for direct inclusion of \\ref KenLM and ARPA language models as WFSAs\r\n- Lattice Minimum Bayes Risk decoding\r\n- Lattice Minimum Error Rate training\r\n- Client/Server mode\r\n- Shallow-N translation grammars\r\n- Source-sentence `chopping' procedures\r\n- WFSA true-casing\r\n\r\n### Tutorial\r\n\r\nFor this release, we have prepared an extensive tutorial that explains how to use these tools. It is available at:\r\n[http://ucam-smt.github.io/tutorial](http://ucam-smt.github.io/tutorial)\r\n\r\nThe tutorial is intended to serve as a guide for the use of the tools, but our research publications contain the best descriptions of the algorithms and modelling techniques described here.\r\nOur complete publications can be found at [ <http://divf.eng.cam.ac.uk/smt/Main/SmtPapers>](http://divf.eng.cam.ac.uk/smt/Main/SmtPapers)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\nThis package grew out of the Ph.D. thesis work of Gonzalo Iglesias, in which he developed HiFST, a hierarchical phrase-based statistical machine translation system based on OpenFST.  \r\n\r\nContributors to this release and the tutorial are:  \r\n- Graeme Blackwood\r\n- Bill Byrne\r\n- Adria de Gispert\r\n- Federico Flego\r\n- Gonzalo Iglesias\r\n- Juan Pino\r\n- Rory Waite\r\n- Tong Xiao\r\n\r\nwith thanks to Cyril Allauzen and Michael Riley, from [www.openfst.org](www.openfst.org).\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nQuestions?
